# Monte Carlo Markov Simulations
I developed this Jupyter Notebook to run parallel Monte Carlo Simulations of Markov Models for Health Economics

## Introduction
This notebook is a Python implementation of a simulation using a Markov Model to estimate costs for two different medical treatments with different associated adverse effects and benefits, Treatment A and Treatment B, over a 20-year period. The simulation is performed using Monte Carlo methods. 

Here's a breakdown of what the Monte Carlo simulation modifies and how it works in this context:
### Monte Carlo Simulation: 
Monte Carlo simulation is a statistical technique used to estimate outcomes of complex systems by generating random samples from known probability distributions. In this case, the simulation is used to estimate the total costs associated with medical treatments.
